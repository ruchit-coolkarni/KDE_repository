# Description of Methodology
**Step 1: Selection of Station Datasets**
To determine which station datasets to include in our analysis, we apply a selection criterion based on data availability. Specifically, a station dataset is included if it contains at least 10% of rainfall records within its available record period. This threshold ensures that only stations with sufficient data coverage are considered for further analysis.

**Step 2: Applying Quality Control Checks on Rainfall Values**
We implement a quality control (QC) process to assess the reliability of rainfall values from all selected station datasets. The following figure illustrates how the data quality control check is applied to each rainfall value. See Figure below for details of the QC procedure.
